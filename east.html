        <p class="ms-2 ms-lg-5"><strong>Bihari Kebab</strong> is a traditional delicacy from Bihar that has gained popularity across India for its smoky, melt-in-the-mouth taste. Unlike regular kebabs, the meat in Bihari kebabs is marinated for hours in a rich blend of spices such as mustard oil, ginger-garlic paste, cumin, coriander, and garam masala, along with yogurt to tenderize it. Thin strips of beef, mutton, or chicken are coated with this marinade and then slow-cooked over charcoal, giving them an irresistible smoky flavor.</p>

It is a delicious wrap made by stuffing spicy, marinated chicken pieces into a flaky paratha or roti, often layered with eggs and onions. The chicken is usually cooked with a blend of flavorful spices, ginger, garlic, and green chilies, giving it a fiery yet tangy taste. Once cooked, it is rolled up with fresh onions, chutneys, and sometimes a squeeze of lemon, making it a portable and satisfying meal.</p>

The dish is made with succulent prawns (chingri) cooked in a luscious gravy of coconut milk, onion, ginger, garlic, and a fragrant mix of Bengali spices. The addition of coconut milk gives the curry a velvety texture and a subtle sweetness that perfectly balances the heat of the spices. A touch of ghee and garam masala at the end elevates the dish, making it truly irresistible.</p>
